# eslint-config

Insurely's ESLint rules for all your course linting needs.
A ruleset based on [Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide][airbnb].

---

## Installation

This is a privately published package via github projects. Before it can be included in a project you need to
add a file called `.npmrc` in the project root folder (same folder as package.json) and add the following to the file:

```bash
@insurely:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/insurely
```

then installe the config as one of your project's `devDependencies`. No other eslint dependencies are needed (other than project specific).

```
npm install --save-dev @insurely/eslint-config
```

## Usage

Then add the extends to your `.eslintrc`:

```javascript
{
  "extends": "@insurely/eslint-config/base",
  "rules": {
    // your overrides
  }
}
```

## Other configs

This config also exposes a few other configs that will be used throughout
the duration of the course.


The config for typescript are created as addition. Use the the following config:

```json
{
  "extends": [ "@insurely/eslint-config/base", "@insurely/eslint-config/typescript" ]
}
```

Same with the config for React:

```json
{
  "extends": [ "@insurely/eslint-config/base", "@insurely/eslint-config/react" ]
}
```

If using webpack you might need to add `eslint-import-resolver-webpack` and extend eslint config with: 
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "import/resolver": "webpack"
  }
}
```



And the config for prettier:
```json
{
  "extends": [ "@insurely/eslint-config/base", "@insurely/eslint-config/prettier" ]
}
```
When using prettier you also need to add the following to your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "prettier": "@insurely/eslint-config/prettierrc"
}
```

## Publishing
Once the package is ready for publishing, run one of the following commands (depending on what the changes to the package include):


If the update includes **major** changes, run:
```bash
npm version major && npm publish && git push origin master
```


If the update includes **minor** change/new rule(s), run:
```bash
npm version minor && npm publish && git push origin master
```


If the update is **a bug fix or smaller changes**, run:
```bash
npm version patch && npm publish && git push origin master
```
